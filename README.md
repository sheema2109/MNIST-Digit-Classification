MNIST Digit Classification using Neural Networks
This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of digits from 0 to 9, each of size 28x28 pixels.
The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and is trained to predict the correct digit from the input image. The final model achieves high accuracy on unseen data and is a great introduction to image classification tasks using deep learning.
Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to understand and apply the basic concepts of deep learning. It involves loading and preprocessing image data, building and training a neural network, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.

Technologies Used
This project is implemented using Python and makes use of the following libraries:
TensorFlow and Keras for building the neural network
Matplotlib for data visualization
NumPy for numerical computations

Dataset
The MNIST dataset is used, which is available directly through TensorFlow's Keras API. It includes 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each labeled with the correct digit.

Steps Followed
1.The steps followed in the project are:
2.Importing the required libraries
3.Loading and exploring the MNIST dataset
4.Preprocessing the data by normalizing pixel values and one-hot encoding the labels
5.Building a feedforward neural network model with hidden layers and dropout
6.Compiling the model using the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss
7.Training the model for 10 epochs with a validation split
8.Evaluating the model on the test dataset
9.Visualizing training accuracy and loss
10.Making predictions and comparing them with actual labels

Results
The final model achieves an accuracy of approximately 97 to 98 percent on the test dataset. Training and validation accuracy trends are also visualized to understand the model's performance over time.
